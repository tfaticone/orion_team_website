	  <div class="col-md-8 proj-description">
          StarRez is looking to diversify themselves from their competitor, provide year round usability,
          and streamline their general manual check-in process through the introduction of a unique and
          innovative software solution. The project is exploratory in nature relying on the commentary from
          stakeholders to drive requirements and design in the form of prototypes. For these reasons
          requirements are going to volatile in nature and the final design and product is not yet determined.
          At a high level, the solution needs to provide a method of checking in students while seamlessly being
          implemented into universities. Specifically, the solution needs to be backwards compatible with old methods
          but open to a new process of dealing with students. As such, the introduction of new technology,
          such as beacons and geofencing have been suggested. This technology would be used as a means of tracking
          and assisting students through the checking in process. Specifically, the arrival to campus and key swapping
          are areas that could benefit from this technology. Though it is important to note that software based solutions
          are preferred over hardware driven solutions. With check in day being one of the biggest days for universities,
          StarRez is looking to provide customers with a better check in experience.
